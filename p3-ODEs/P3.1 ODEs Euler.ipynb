    "Unstable nuclei like ${}^{235}$U, can undergo radioactive decay and break apart into two smaller nuclei along with other decay products. We cannot know precisely when a particular nu- cleus will decay due to the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle, but we can know the probability that it will have decayed after some time.\n",

    "Consider radioactive decay from another perspective. Rather than look at a single ${}^{235}$U nucleus, look at a very large number of nuclei. If we know the probability that a single nucleus will decay after some period of time, then given a large number of nuclei, we can determine the fraction that remain after that period of time. Because the number of nuclei that will decay after some time is proportional to the number that were there to begin with, the rate of change of the number of nuclei is proportional to the number of nuclei. That is, $dN(t)/dt$ is proportional to $N(t)$, where $N(t)$ is the number of nuclei present at time t. Thus, the evolution of $N(t)$ is given by\n",
